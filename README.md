## Aniaml Clinic

### Milestone 1:
In this Milestone, I created a new data base with a single animal table, added values and created some queries.

### Milestone 2:
✅ Added a new column to animals table called species 🧬
✅ Inserted new animals into the database. 🦁 🐢 🌱
✅ Added transactions 💸 🪙
✅ Wrote new queries to answer the questions ❓

## Getting Started
 - Use [schema.sql](https://github.com/AlexRS90/vet-clinic/blob/animal-table/schema.sql) to create all tables.
 - Use [data.sql](https://github.com/AlexRS90/vet-clinic/blob/animal-table/data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
 - Check [queries.sql](https://github.com/AlexRS90/vet-clinic/blob/animal-table/queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!
